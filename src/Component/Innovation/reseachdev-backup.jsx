                  Technology has been central to everything Reliance has ever
                  done. From our very first textile plant to the world’s largest
                  greenfield refinery to our latest telecom business Jio – all
                  utilise the best available technology to create timeless
                  assets that give long-term returns to stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reliance is actively involved in the development of novel and
                  proprietary catalysts, processes and products to improve
                  profitability and accelerate our growth. Our company has
                  transitioned from a smart buyer of technology to a fast
                  customizer of technology and is a flagship developer which
                  provides business leadership through largely in-house
                  developed technology that creates significant value. R&D
                  enables the innovation based growth agenda for Reliance.
